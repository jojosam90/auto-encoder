# Auto-Encoder
Autoencoding is a data compression algorithm where the compression and decompression functions are:
- data-specific: which means that they will only be able to compress data similar to what they have been trained on.
- lossy : which means that the decompressed outputs will be degraded compared to the original inputs
- learned automatically from examples rather than engineered by a human. It doesnâ€™t require any new engineering, just appropriate training data.

## Anomaly Detection 
- process of finding abnormalities in data. Abnormal data means the ones that deviate significantly from general behavior of data.
- Application : fraud detection, fault detection
